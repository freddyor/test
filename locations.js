 'tldr': 'This bridge was the only means of crossing the River Ouse by road for 1,000 years. The first structure built here was during the Anglo-Scandinavian 9th century, when a timber bridge was erected here due to the natural narrowing of the Ouse channel. This bridge survived until 1154, when it collapsed due to a large crowd gathering to welcome William of York. A new stone bridge was built roughly 20 years later and was quickly lined with houses and shops, so much so that by 1435 there were 55 buildings on the bridge, including a chapel, a council chamber, a Lord Mayor’s chamber, a courtroom and two prisons. This bridge tragically collapsed during a 1564 flood, killing 12 people. The new bridge, opened in 1566, had five arches, with the central one 81 feet wide and more than 17 feet high. In 1724, author Daniel Dafoe described the bridge as ‘without exception, the greatest in England’. Ultimately, the bridge was too steep for road traffic so it was demolished in 1810, with this current bridge being built in 1821.',
